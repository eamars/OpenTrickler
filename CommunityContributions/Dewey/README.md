My personal mods for OpenTrickler!

I have made both Version 1 and 2 of the OpenTrickler, and it's my all-time favorite 3DP project. I've included a Version 2 cutout of the bearing plate on this homepage to test your bearing fit before printing full pieces, as I believe the bearing test should be your very first print. You can quickly adjust your X-Y Hole Compensation if needed before committing a large amount of your filament to the main pieces. EAMARS designed some bearing tolerance, so I recommend starting with zero Hole Compensation and go from there.

I've included some of my personal mods and my mods of other contributors. Have a look around and see if anything jumps out.

Mod highlights:
- Bearing plate for test fitting
- Hide the wires under the shield plate
- New rear bearing plate works with Ball Powder, both in version 1 and 2 of the Open Trickler
- Windowed front body using plexiglass, easily scored and cracked
- Front body with or without servos
- Front/Back spacer plates for tighter fit
- Wider top covers, easier to slide on
- Plug for the Lee Hopper adapter
- Small mods to Hayamini's controller board housing
- More to come....

I also have some free designs if you're interested in additional 3DP reloading/precision tools on Printables: https://www.printables.com/@DIY_Dewey
