FrontBodyCover 0.6mm Wider - My printed top covers are always too tight (both V1 and V2). I'm sure its something with my printer setting, but this mod was easier and faster to do than troubleshoot my print settings. I widened the gap by 0.6mm, which seems to be perfect. 

FrontBodyV2.Windowed - This is my mod to use a DIY rectangular cut piece of plexiglass. I order this 2mm but it measured 1.8mm: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN16MRHP?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1
Print the Window Test Piece to see if it slides in correctly. You can mod the CAD file if yours is a different thickness.

FrontBodyV2.Windowed_NoServos - same as above, but without the servo mounts and cutouts for the shutter gates.

FrontVolumeReducerBack Spacers - bearing plates with added spacers, if you need a tighter fit.

PlexiJigs - These are guides for scoring the plexiglass window. The final window size is 62mm x 38mm. You might only need the first 2 jigs, depending on your sheet size.

Mattyy_P's Extended Servo Supports - I added them here as well, because I believe it is a excellent mod. These are the same STLs pulled from his contribution folder. Check it out for more info.

Z.V2FrontBodyNoShutter -  This is not my mod, but this was provided in Discord. It is uploaded here for convenience if someone wanted to use it. Unknown author.
