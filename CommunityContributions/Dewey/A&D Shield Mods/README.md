These mods route the servo and/or motor wires underneath the Adapter Plate for a CLEAN look and away from moving belts.

Scale Shield - this mod has 2x cutouts on the left and right side for user preference. If you're using HayaminiNL's controller board side case (or my updated/modded version), the front cutout is for the servo wires, and the rear cutout is for the motor wires; recommend print with brim.

Feeder Plugs - Print these plugs to fill the unused cutouts in the modded scale shield.

Adapter Plate - 3a - holes large enough for the servo/motor JST plugs, and holes for mounting Dirtbit's display controller housing while using my modded                         controller board side case; recommend print with brim.

3b - servo and motor JST holes only; NO holes for mounting display controller; recommend print with brim.

Motor and Servo Wires Plug - OPTIONAL; small plugs if you want to tuck the wires even closer; I designed them but typically don't use them.

Case Body Bottom - Hayamini's design, but I modded the back holes to fit JST plugs through; use 2x SHCS M3x12, 2x M3 nut; print with mouse ears or brim recommended.

Case Body Top - Hayamini's design, but I modded the serial port opening wider to allow room for the studs for attaching the serial cable. Use the same SHCS 4x M3x30, 4x M3 nut; print with mouse ears or brim recommended; supports aren't needed. I used these standoffs: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KWVPZC2?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1

Case Rear Bracket - Hayamini's unmodded design; copied for convenience; may need to rotate for printing; use 2x BHCS M3x10.

Cup Holster - Securely stores the powder cup in the front shield cover lid. Simply re-print this mod and replace your lid!
