Ball Powder Bearing Plate - This works with Version 1 & 2 of the OpenTrickler!! I enlarged the openings slightly, added a 60 degree chamfer, and removed the bearing reliefs. This is a modified V2 plate, so there is a larger opening around the V1 fine trickler tube, which is completely OK if your bearings are sealed. 
- IF YOU ARE INSTALLING IN A VERSION 1 TRICKLER, YOU MUST PRINT THE VERSION 2 VOLUME REDUCER AND REAR DOOR TO GO WITH IT! I prefer my modded rear door with 0.4mm spacer for a nice, snug fit.

I have used this plate very successfully with LeverEvolution and CFE223. It is easy to clean afterwards with a small blower and a toothpick or small paint brush.

Front/Rear Door Spacer - These spacers add additional layers to make a tighter fit when sliding in or out. I use it to snug the volume reducer right up to the bearing plate to eliminate powder getting stuck in the gap.

Lee Hopper Adapter - This is Golmeth's mod, which I simply made the gap 0.6mm wider so it slides on easier.

Lee Hopper Plug - A plug for the Lee Hopper adapter, too keep out debris when not in use.
